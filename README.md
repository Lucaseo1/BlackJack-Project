# Basic Rules of Black Jack

How Blackjack works is the Player and Dealer both start with two cards
The goal is to get the highest possible total hand without going over 21
Based on your first two cards you can choose to hit or stand
If hit is chosen you will draw another card
If stand is chosen you will not draw any and your turns over
At the end of both players drawing whoever has the higher total without going over 21 wins
If somebody goes over 21 the player busts and the other person wins
This code runs the game Blackjack as long as you run the code. It functions how a Blackjack game normally would
Run the code and then follow the prompts in the terminal to play

# How the Code Runs

The code runs in the terminal and will print statements
Follow along in the terminal and follow what it says
It will display both hands to the player than ask if they want to hit or stand
If the player goes over 21 the dealer wins automatically
If the players turns over the dealer draws until he has 17 or higher total
